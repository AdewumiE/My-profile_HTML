                        dissatisfaction on a consumer's behalf to a responsible party" (London, 1980). It can also be
                        described in a positive sense as a report from a consumer providing documentation about a
                        problem with a product or service.[1] In fact, some modern business consultants urge businesses
                        to view customer complaints as a gift.[2][3]

                        Consumer complaints are usually informal complaints directly addressed to a company or public
                        service provider, and most consumers manage to resolve problems with products and services but
                        it sometimes requires persistence. An instrumental complaint is a complaint made to a person or
                        organization that could take some action and bring about a specific remedy.[4] An expressive
                        complaint is a complaint made for the purpose of expressing feelings, without any realistic
                        chance of anything being done.[4] Most online complaints are expressive complaints.[4]<BR>
